## Purpose

This repository contains the Perl implementation of the Sereal serialization protocol.
Sereal is optimized first for efficient, correct round-tripping of Perl data structures.
The Perl implementation is the reference-quality implementation in practice: it is the most complete, receives the most maintenance, and drives most protocol and compatibility work.

The three core Perl distributions are:

- `Sereal::Decoder` in [`Decoder/`](./Decoder)
- `Sereal::Encoder` in [`Encoder/`](./Encoder)
- `Sereal` in [`Sereal/`](./Sereal), a wrapper/meta distribution that depends on both

The wrapper exists for convenience, but encoder and decoder are intentionally releasable as separate distributions. That separation is important policy, not an accident: decoders must remain safe to upgrade independently so mixed-version fleets can read older data during rollout.

This repo also contains adjacent projects such as `Path/`, `Merger/`, and `Splitter/`. Unless the task explicitly concerns those subprojects, treat `Encoder/`, `Decoder/`, `Sereal/`, and `shared/` as the main maintenance surface.

## Core design and compatibility policy

- The decoder must preserve backwards readability. A current decoder should be safe to deploy before encoder upgrades.
- Changes that affect wire compatibility, decode safety, thaw behavior, malformed-input handling, or recursion behavior are high-risk and should be treated conservatively.
- Prefer fixing compatibility in the decoder first when sequencing matters.
- `Sereal` is only a dependency wrapper. Real feature work normally belongs in `Encoder` and/or `Decoder`, with `Sereal/Changes` updated to summarize the same release.
- `shared/` contains code and test infrastructure used by multiple distributions. Changes there often affect both encoder and decoder behavior.

## Repository-specific build behavior

- The file [`this_is_the_Sereal_repo.txt`](./this_is_the_Sereal_repo.txt) is intentionally present and used to detect source-repo builds. Do not remove it.
- Source-repo builds use shared files from `shared/` and local `blib` wiring when building `Sereal`.
- `Encoder/Makefile.PL` and `Decoder/Makefile.PL` may prompt for build options outside source-repo mode. `CPAN_COMPAT=1` forces CPAN-style prompting behavior during testing of packaging/build changes.
- `SEREAL_USE_BUNDLED_LIBS=1` is used by the repo’s main build script.

## Main commands

- Full clean rebuild and distribution check:
  - `./clean_make_all`
- Normal repo build/test/dist flow:
  - `./make_all`
- Regenerate shared headers/constants and perltidy Perl files:
  - `./clean_regen_and_tidy`

`./make_all` currently does this:

1. `git clean -dfX`
2. Build `Decoder`
3. Build `Encoder`
4. Test, `make manifest`, and `make dist` for `Decoder`
5. Test, `make manifest`, and `make dist` for `Encoder`
6. Test, `make manifest`, and `make dist` for `Sereal`

When working only in one distribution, targeted `perl Makefile.PL && make test` in that subdirectory is fine during iteration, but final verification for release-oriented or cross-cutting work should use the repo scripts.

## Change expectations

- Library behavior changes should come with tests.
- User-visible behavior changes should come with documentation updates.
- Protocol, freeze/thaw, security, malformed-input, and version-compatibility changes should usually add or extend regression tests.
- Prefer small, self-contained, incremental patches that build toward the goal.
- If the task requires a larger cross-cutting patch, call that out explicitly in the commit message and changelog text.

## Release policy

- `Sereal`, `Sereal::Encoder`, and `Sereal::Decoder` should always be released together.
- Every release should update:
  - `Encoder/Changes`
  - `Decoder/Changes`
  - `Sereal/Changes`
- Version bumps are normally done with `fixver.pl`, then changelog entries are updated, then the emitted shell commands are used to test, commit, tag, push, and upload.
- `fixver.pl` also shows the canonical release commit message and tag format.

Current release flow:

1. Run `perl fixver.pl VERSION REASON`
2. Update all three `Changes` files
3. Run the emitted `./clean_make_all`
4. If clean, use the emitted `git commit`, `git tag`, `git push`, and upload commands

Release commit format is strict:

- `Release v5.009 - Fix build ZSTD build issue on some platforms`
- `Release v5.004_001 - Update ZStd, other changes`

Tag format is also strict:

- `Sereal-Decoder-<version>`
- `Sereal-Encoder-<version>`
- `Sereal-<version>`

## Dev releases vs production releases

- Significant build-system or packaging changes are hard to validate locally across the CPAN matrix.
- For those changes, prefer a developer release with an underscore version, then review CPAN Testers results before doing the production release.
- Minor build changes can go out directly if the local test evidence is strong enough.
- Library changes are usually safer to validate with the test suite and can often go straight to a production release if well covered.
- Re-releasing is acceptable when necessary; optimize for safety, not ritual.

Examples from existing history:

- Dev releases for build/test validation: `5.000_001`, `5.001_001`, `5.001_002`, `5.002_001`, `5.002_002`, `5.004_001`
- Production releases consolidating validated dev work: `5.002`, `5.003`

## Changelog conventions

- Changelog entries are concise and operational.
- Lead with the user-visible outcome or maintenance reason.
- Credit contributors when appropriate.
- `Sereal/Changes` is a summary/meta changelog for the wrapper distribution, not the primary place for deep technical detail.
- If decoder-first upgrade safety matters for a release, say so explicitly. Existing changelogs already use warnings like “Upgrade *Sereal::Decoder* FIRST.”

## Commit message conventions

Based on Yves’s history, use short subject lines with a clear area first when not doing a release commit.

Common patterns:

- `Decoder/t/195_backcompat.t - test against older versions output`
- `Makefile.PL - add CPAN_COMPAT env var to simulate CPAN style build`
- `Perl: add FREEZE/THAW class allow-lists to Encoder/Decoder`
- `THAW ordering fixes - use LIFO order for nested objects`
- `shared/zstd: update zstd to the latest verion at time of building`

Guidelines:

- For release commits, use the exact `Release v<version> - <reason>` format from `fixver.pl`.
- For normal commits, start with the most relevant subsystem, file, or topic.
- Keep the summary short and concrete.
- Prefer one logical change per commit.
- If the change is a test-only or build-only change, say so directly.

## Testing guidance

- For core encoder/decoder behavior changes, test both directions when relevant:
  - new encoder output can be decoded correctly
  - current decoder still handles older serialized data
- Pay special attention to:
  - freeze/thaw behavior
  - recursion and aliasing
  - malformed or hostile input
  - compression backends (`snappy`, `zlib`, `zstd`)
  - older Perl compatibility, especially 5.8-era constraints still reflected in the codebase
- Existing tests such as `Decoder/t/195_backcompat.t` and files under `shared/t/700_roundtrip/` are important indicators of compatibility expectations.

## Editing guidance

- Keep changes narrow and local when possible.
- Avoid gratuitous style churn in XS/C/shared vendored code.
- Do not remove old-version compatibility logic casually; much of it exists for a real CPAN/platform reason.
- Treat bundled third-party code updates such as `shared/zstd/`, `shared/miniz.*`, and `shared/snappy/` as vendor updates: minimize unrelated edits and document the version bump clearly.
- If changing shared build logic, expect consequences in both `Encoder` and `Decoder`, and verify accordingly.

## Agent checklist

Before finishing work, verify which category the change falls into:

- Core library behavior
- Decoder safety/backcompat
- Build/packaging/tooling
- Release engineering
- Adjacent subproject work (`Path`, `Merger`, `Splitter`)

Then make sure the patch matches the policy:

- tests added or updated where behavior changed
- docs updated where user-visible behavior changed
- all three `Changes` files updated for releases
- dev release used for significant build-system risk
- commit message follows local conventions
